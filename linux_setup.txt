Both Python2 and Python3 are installed on most Linux distros by default

Do all of this in a terminal.

   PIP is not usually installed on Linux
     sudo apt install python3-pip

   pip3 uses the python3 installer   
     sudo pip3 install praw

test to see is praw installed 
     python3

>> import praw
 
if no error message comes up then it is installed.
