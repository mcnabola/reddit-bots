naviagate to the directory that you want in the terminal 

if on windows type > dir
if on GNU/Linux ;^) or Mac type > ls

to see where the terminal is currently pointed.

To navigate to other directories type > cd the_folder
so if you are in home and want to move to Documents 
cd Documents

When you are in the directory with your script. Type 

python3 your_script.py

experiment with using python your_script.py and guess why it does work or it doesnt work.

This depends on if python2 is also installed. 
If its not python on its own will work 

do both python and python3 have the same result?



===

Windows - open the python script in idle
The above steps would have worked for you but theres an alternative
To open idle, press the windows key and type idle open and code from there
To run press f5
